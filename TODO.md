# TODO for QuikDecision web application

   * Consider moving all static pages, including main, to gwadej.org
      - Would need to redirect http://qd.gwadej.org/ -> gwadej.org/quikdecision.html or whatever
   * Bunny icon for quik like a bunny
   * Maybe make the copyright less subtle now
   * Expand openapi.yaml docs to do a better job with help
   * Provide better help interface for QuikDecision
      - API endpoint returning help?
      - FAQ pages describing functionality
   * Improve styling on main page
   * Add styling to static pages
